    <h2> Stage 0: 1.1 Learning the basics of HTML </h2>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3> 0.1 What is HTML for? </h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        HTML is used for web development. Almost all web pages uses HTML as its markup language.
        HTML means <em> HyperText Markup Language.</em>
        HTML is the most popular language used in web development.
        <br>And the good news is that HTML is relatively easy to learn.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>0.2 HTML tags</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        HTML tags are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content in a web page.
        <br>Most HTML tags consist of an opening and a closing tag.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3> 0.3 Text markdown tips</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        for bold you must use b to open a tag and /b to close it.
        <br>for italic you must use em and /em.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>0.4 Examples</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Hello, my name is <strong>Bold</strong> and I am a tool for people put their phrases in a strong way.
        <br><em>Hi, Mr Bold. I am italic, i am from Italy </em>
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>0.5 Additional HTML tags:</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        <br> p and /p defines a paragraph. 
        <br> br creates a line break.
        <br> div and /div creates a "box" containter element
        <br> span and /span creates an "inline" container element.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>0.6 HTML elements</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        HTML elements usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>0.7 Inline and block - HTML elements</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        HTML elements are either <strong>inline</strong> or <strong>block</strong>. Block
        elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them, stretching out to the left and right as far as possible.
        Block elements always start a new line while Inline elements does not. Inline elements only uses as much width as necessary.
      </div>
</div>




  <div class="h2">
    <h2> Stage 1: 1.2 Creating a Structured Document</h2>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.1 Developer tools</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Access the Developer tools in Google Chrome using Crtl+Shift+I. So you can view the structure of a web page. The panel on the right is the styles panel, which is used for CSS. All visible elements are rectangular.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.2 Tags and tree-like structures </h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Tags and ident form Tree Like Structures or DOM
        The browser turns HTML tags into elements that turn into a tree.
        The three-like structure refers to the fact that HTML elements can have other elements embedded in them.
      </div>


    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.3 DOM</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Dom is the way the browser reads your code and turn it on a webpage. It is linked to the Tree-like Structure
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.4 CSS what is it?</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        CSS are a web development language that controls how the webpage will look.
        While HTML controls the structure, CSS controls the colors, fonts and style and sizes.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.5 How it works?</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Web developers have to give similar elements the same classname so then specify the style to be applied to that class.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.6 The web page world is based on boxes</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        In webpages, all elements are in a box. They are all in boxes because it makes it easier to rearrange the website. So Web pages are simply boxes within boxes. Look at a web design as boxes, starting large and then smaller as this is how you'll write the HTML.
      </div>


    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.7 Boxes to HTML</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Start by breaking down the boxes into div tags. Add content between tags to remember the content, eg. Header, body, footer. Add class names, be as specific as possible, think labeling moving boxes.
      </div>


    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.8 The Box Model</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        The box model includes the margin, border, padding and content. By default, the size of the actual element is the sum of the border, padding and content width.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.9 The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.10 Span and Div</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        Span and div can both contain text. Span is an inline, and div is block.
        Once you have used Span or Div, you can attach CSS styles to change the way they look.
      </div>

    <div class="h3">
      <h3>1.11 Text Editors (for coding)</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="description">
        When writing code, professional programmers use text editors - Webstorm/Atom/Sublime Text.
        These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors add automatically a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.<p> But we, beginners, will take advantage using other useful tools like scratchpad.io because you immediately see what you are coding.
        I suggest you to try this website:</p>
